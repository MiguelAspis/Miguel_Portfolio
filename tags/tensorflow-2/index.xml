      <description>Time series forecasting project done on the monthly mean sunspot number 1749-2018 dataset using Tensroflow and Keras Sequential API to design a number of very simple models to test on this problem, the goal was not to get the performance possible but to recall the workflow of working with time series data and how to do forecasting with it. More can be read in the notebook located on the project&amp;rsquo;s github repo</description>

      <description>Music classification project with the intent of classifying different songs based on their genre using the Marsyas dataset and using 2 architectures, a small convolutional neural network and a recurrent neural network with LSTM cells. Accompanied by audio preprocessing routine which was done on each music sample to be able to feed it to the NNs using the librosa library. The whole project can be seen on the github repo</description>

      <description>Basic Image classification A project done using a simple CNN architecture to do image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Steps of the process include:
 Importing the data One-hot enconding it Defining 1st basic CNN using Keras high-level Sequential API Training and evaluating Defining a bit bigger model Training and evaluating Comparing both and concluding  more can be read on the project&amp;rsquo;s github repo</description>
